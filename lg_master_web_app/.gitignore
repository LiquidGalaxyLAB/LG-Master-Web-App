# This file is used to tell Git which files and folders it should ignore and not track 
# It does NOT delete these folders and files, it just ignores them
# This is useful because only the important files are tracked and shared this way, saving space
# This also prevents problems like accidentally sharing sensitive data or files that are automatically created

/coverage/                                 # This folder is created when you run tests to see how much of your code is tested
                                           # It contains a report showing what parts of the code were tested
                                           # You can safely ignore this folder, as its just for your own information and will be recreated automatically if needed
/ios/Flutter/ephemeral/                    # This folder is created automatically when building for iOS (Apple devices)
                                           # It is temporary and not needed in your project files, as it can be rebuilt as is not meant to be edited
/android/Flutter/ephemeral/                # This folder is created automatically when building for Android devices
                                           # It is also temporary and can be easily rebuilt
/android/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java    # This file is generated by Flutter when you add plugins to your project
                                           # When you update your dependencies (listed in pubspec.yaml) the file will also be updated or regenerated
                                           # It will be created again automatically, even if it is missing
/ios/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.*           # These files are also generated by Flutter for iOS plugins
                                           # Since this file is automatically generated and can be different for every developer, saving it can lead to conflicts
                                           # It will be recreated automatically if needed

# -----------------------------------IDE (CODE EDITOR) SETTINGS-----------------------------------
.vscode/      # This folder stores settings for Visual Studio Code
              # These are personal and not needed tu run the app or for other users to build it
              # If you delete this folder VSCode will simply recreate it as needed
.idea/        # This folder stores settings for IntelliJ or Android Studio editors
              # As the vscode folder, these are personal
              # If you delete this folder it will be recreated next time you open the project
*.iml         # These are project files made by IntelliJ or Android Studio
              # They are different for each developer or computer
              # If you delete them, they will simply be recreated next time you open the project
*.swp         # Temporary swap files created by the Vim text editor (used by Linux and macOS)
              # They are created while editing a file to help recover your work in case something goes wrong
              # They are only used while editing, they are NOT part of your app
              # Once you close Vim, these files are deleted automatically, and if for some reason they're left behind, you can safely delete them
*.swo         # More temporary files from Vim, not part of the project or app
              # They also work as backup files while editing

# -----------------------------------OS FILES-----------------------------------
.DS_Store     # DS_Store stans for Desktop Services Store
              # Hidden file created by Mac computers to remember how you like to view folders (icon positions, window size, etc)
              # It is personal and can cause problems if shared, such as expose your information
              # If you delete a .DS_Store file, macOS will create a new one next time you open a folder
Thumbs.db     # Hidden file created by Windows computers to remember folder thumbnails
              # It is personal and can cause problems if shared and not part of your project
              # If you delete a Thumbs.db file, Windows will create a new one next time you view the folder in thumbnail mode


# -----------------------------------DEPENDENCIES (DOWNLOADED LIBRARIES)-----------------------------------
.packages        # This file lists all the code libraries and packages your project uses
                 # It is automatically generated by Flutter and not needed in your project files
                 # The real list of dependencies is un pubspec.yaml, which you DO need to keep and share 
.pub-cache/      # This folder stores downloaded libraries (packages) your project depends on
                 # It acts as a local storage for download dependencies so you don't have to download them again for each project
                 # It is created automatically, and including it in version control would add a large number of unnecessary files
pubspec.lock     # CAREFUL! You cannot always ignore this file
                 # This file is automatically created by Flutter when you get or update the project's dependencies
                 # It records the exact versions of every package your project uses, including all indirect dependencies (packages used by the packages)
                 # YOU CAN IGNORE IT IF you are building a package meant to be used by other projects (a library)
                 # YOU CAN IGNORE IT IF you are the only person working on the app, since you control your own environment
                 # YOU SHOULD NOT IGNORE IT IF you are working with multiple developers on an app
                 # Still, even if you are working alone, not ignoring it will give you a safer and more stable development environment 
                 # This is because including it ensures that everyone working on the app uses the exact same versions of dependencies 
                 # Deleting it is not usually harmful, but it can affect the app's stability
