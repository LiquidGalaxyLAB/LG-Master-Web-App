// -------------------------------------------- AI SCREEN --------------------------------------------
// This screen gives information about how to integrate AI on your project to generate responses based on prompts
// It sends a POST request to the Gemini API and displays the AI response on the screen

// ------------------------------------- HOW TO GET A GEMINI API KEY -------------------------------------
// FOR GEMINI:
// Sign in to your Google account
// Go to Google AI Studio
// Look for the 'Gemini API' tab or a button that says 'Get API key in Google AI Studio'
// Click 'Get API Key' or 'Create API Key'
// Review and accept the terms of service
// Copy your API key. DO NOT SHARE IT OR COPY IT INTO PUBLIC CODE REPOSITORIES!!!
// Copy your API key into the .env file, specifiy in .gitgnore to ignore this file so it will not be uploaded to GitHub

// ---------------------- Import packages ----------------------
import 'dart:convert'; // For coding and decoding JSON
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Imports the library material.dart (which contains common widgets like buttons, text, etc.) from Flutter's SDK (Software Development Kit)
import 'package:http/http.dart'
    as http; // HTTP client to send requests to the Gemini API
import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart'; // Used to load and access environment variables from a .env file

// ---------------------- API configuration parameters ----------------------
// ---- Gemini endpoint with given model and API key ----
final String geminiApiUrl =
    'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=${dotenv.env['GEMINI_API_KEY']}';

// This is the Gemini endpoint
// An endpoint is a way to a specific resource or function on a server
// https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/ is the base URL
// v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent specifies the gemini model (gemini-2.0-flash in this case) and calls its generateContent method
// This model works for my API key, but always check which models work for YOUR API key
// ?key=${dotenv.env['GEMINI_API_KEY']} appends the API key as a query parameter for authentication and authorization
// dotenv.env['GEMINI_API_KEY'] returns the value of GEMINI_API_KEY from the file
// The API key is EXTREMELY sensitive information
// It should be in an .env file that should be specified to be ignored in .gitignore
// The .env file MUST be specified in the pubspec assets section!
// The .env file MUST also be outside the "lib" folder, on the same level as pubspec.yaml

// ---------------------- AI Screen widget ----------------------
// AIScreen class is the root widget of the screen, and all other widgets are built from there
// This means that all the other parts of the screen (buttons, text, etc) will be built from this starting point
// It extends StatefulWidget because its state changes after a few seconds
// If it did NOT change, we would use StatelessWidget
class AIScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const AIScreen({super.key});
  // 'super' indicates that, if this widget receives a key, it will be passed to the parent class so Flutter knows about it
  // This helps Flutter identify and track this widget when rebuilding the screen
  // It basically passes an optional key to the parent widget for identification during widget rebuilds

  @override
  // @override is a line that indicates a method from the parent class is going to be replaced
  // In this case, we are replacing the initState() method that comes from Flutter's State class
  // @override is not mandatory but it is really useful, as it helps catch mistakes
  // Dart will show an error if you try to override something that does not exist

  State<AIScreen> createState() => _AIScreenState();
  // This line creates the mutable state associated with AIScreen
  // The state object will hold the logic for what the AI screen does
}

// ---------------------- AI screen state ----------------------
// This class manages the state (in other words, the behavior) of the AI screen
// The state of a widget is basically the changing data
// In Flutter a State class is where the data that can be changed while the app is running is stored and managed
// When the state changes, the widget rebuilds itself to show the new data
class _AIScreenState extends State<AIScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  // Creates a controller to manage and retrieve the text entered in the input field
  // It allows to get the current value of the input, clear the input and listen for changes if needed

  String _response = '';
  // Stores the Gemini AI response
  // Initialized as an empty string because nothings has been received yet
  // Will be updated after the user sends a message and the AI returns an answer

  bool _loading = false;
  // Tracks if the app is waiting for a response from Gemini
  // true means a request is in progress
  // false means a request is not in progress, which means introducing an input is allowed
  // That is ahy false is the default value

  // ---- Send prompt to Gemini ----
  Future<void> _sendPrompt() async {
    // Defines an asynchronous method that does not return any value (void)
    // 'async' allows to use 'await' inside the function
    // It does not return any value because its function is to trigger a side-effect (connecting to a service), not to return data

    final prompt = _controller.text.trim();
    // Gets the user input the _controller
    // _controller is an object that controls a text field in Flutter and lets you read, change, and clear the text
    // .trim() removes any leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the input
    // This makes sure the API is not called with just spaces or empty lines
    // This process is called trimming
    // The result is stored in the variable called 'prompt'

    if (prompt.isEmpty) return;
    // Checks if the userâ€™s input is empty after trimming
    // If it is, the function exits and no request is sent
    // This prevents sending invalid or empty prompts to the Gemini API

    setState(() {

      _loading = true;
      // If _loading = true, this means a request is in progress

    });

    try {
      // Build the request body in the format required by the Gemini API
      // Keep in mind this is the structure for Gemini API, other models may have other structures

      final body = jsonEncode({

        // This variable will hold the final JSON string that will be sent in the POST request to the Gemini API

        // But be careful!!! Different models may have different structures

          }
        ],
        // Careful with parameters like "temperature" and "maxOutputTokens"!!!!
        // Depending on the model, they might not be allowed and your code will not work if you use them
        // Anyway, just so you have some info:

        // "temperature" controls how random the AI answers are
        // 0.0 means predictable and safe
        // 1.0 means creative and random

        // "maxOutputTokens" is the maximum number of tokens (words or parts of words) the response can contain
        // This helps control the length of the answer
      });
